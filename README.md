This is an incredibly easy mailchimp integration for a newsletter subscription form/widget.

### Installation

To install, unzip it into your apps folder.(Or install through git routine).

Visit the link "Newsletter" in your admin tools, on the first time you will be asked for your mailchimp API key. That's it, you're done with installation.


### Using Newsletter Widget
You can use it in any page, or block element. Simply click the "Newsletter : Subscription Widget" and select the mailing list you wish the individual to subscribe to.

You can have as many widgets on your site, and even an single page as you want.


### Admin Page

This is a quick view some of the major stats about your mailing campaigns.


### Support and Updates

There is no official support or updates planned. You can seek help at http://www.elefantcms.com/forum. I will be working on this as I see fit. If you submit a pull request I will review it.
